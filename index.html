<h3>You can publish a book!  Right now!</h3>

<p>Book publishing is radically different from what it was just a few years ago, and it is insanely easy to publish
a <em>buyable</em> book with the right mentality and a few simple techniques &amp; tools.  This website is supporting an
&ldquo;intersession&rdquo; at <a href="http://girlsms.org/">Girls&#8217; Middle School</a>, but the content may be useful on its own.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>For you to have a printed book in your hands by the end of the week, and for you to have a <em>buyable</em> book
on Amazon also by the end of the week.  These are the core goals.</p>

<p>Additional goals would be for you to understand traditional publishing through &ldquo;literary agents&rdquo;, a bit about
different book sizes, costs, pricing, translation, editing, and so on.</p>

<h2>Relevant Bio</h2>

<p>A year ago, I was not a mass-market published author.  I had written things and printed things, and people had
read and valued what I wrote.  But I had never had my own book, buyable by anyone.  But back in May, all that
changed.  I started writing a memoir <a href="http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/">The Slums of Palo Alto</a> and
within a week I had <em>a book</em>.  And by the end of September, I had <em>a buyable book</em>.  I may have been rejected
by 42 literary agents (yes forty-two agents), but I was a published author.  You can buy and read my book today
if you want!</p>

<p>My goal for the intersession is to show you how easy publishing a book is.  I am not going to teach you how to
write.  You must come with your own writing, or borrow someone else&rsquo;s (maybe from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">http://www.gutenberg.org/</a>).
But I will teach you how to transform words on paper into <em>a book</em>.  And transform <em>a book</em> into <em>a buyable book</em>.
It is totally awesome!  And you will be too! (Well, more awesome than you already are :&ndash;)</p>

<h2>Supporting materials online</h2>

<ul>
<li> &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo;, a truly minimal buyable book.  See: <a href="https://www.createspace.com/5016251">https://www.createspace.com/5016251</a></li>
<li> &ldquo;The Slums of Palo Alto (Preview Edition, BW)&rdquo;.  See: <a href="https://www.createspace.com/4839830">https://www.createspace.com/4839830</a>

<ul>
<li>Also pretty minimal for a memoirs, but significantly more &lsquo;viable&rsquo; than &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; for a broad audience</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> &ldquo;The Slums of Palo Alto (Preview Edition, C)&rdquo;.  See: <a href="https://www.createspace.com/4875705">https://www.createspace.com/4875705</a>
