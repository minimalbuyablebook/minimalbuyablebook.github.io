<h3>You can publish a book!  Right now!</h3>

<p>Book publishing is radically different from what it was just a few years ago, and it is insanely easy to publish
a <em>buyable</em> book with the right mentality and a few simple techniques &amp; tools.  This website is supporting an
&ldquo;intercession&rdquo; at <a href="http://girlsms.org/">Girls&#8217; Middle School</a>, but the content may be useful on its own.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>For you to have a printed book in your hands by the end of the week, and for you to have a <em>buyable</em> book
on Amazon also by the end of the week.  These are the core goals.</p>

<p>Additional goals would be for you to understand traditional publishing through &ldquo;literary agents&rdquo;, a bit about
different book sizes, costs, pricing, translation, and so on.</p>

<h2>Relevant Bio</h2>

<p>A year ago, I was not a mass-market published author.  I had written things and printed things, and people had
read and valued what I wrote.  But I had never had my own book, buyable by anyone.  But back in May, all that
changed.  I started writing a memoir <a href="http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/">The Slums of Palo Alto</a> and
within a week I had <em>a book</em>.  And by the end of September, I had <em>a buyable book</em>.  I may have been rejected
by 42 literary agents (yes forty-two agents), but I was a published author.  You can buy my book today if you want!</p>

<p>My goal for the intercession is to show you how easy publishing a book is.  I am not going to teach you how to
write.  You must come with your own writing, or borrow someone else&rsquo;s (maybe from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">http://www.gutenberg.org/</a>).
But I will teach you how to transition from words on paper to <em>a book</em>.  And from <em>a book</em> to <em>a buyable book</em>.
It is totally awesome!  And so you will be too!</p>
