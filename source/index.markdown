###Join us for a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/FullOfLifeFood/">Meat-Up</a> to get some incredibly tasty food!

Full Of Life Food (aka FoLF) is a cooperative purchasing group that enables farmers and ranchers
to produce and distribute their amazing foods without the burden of dealing with individualized delivery and sales.

The founder and his family have been purchasing food from the [Mountain View Farmers' Market](https://www.facebook.com/MVFarmersMkt) for twenty years.
Sadly, we have seen farmers leave the market due to its overhead, including recently [Full of Life Farm](https://www.fulloflifefarm.com/).
FoLF is trying to enable these farmers and ranchers to have a better cost model by "crowd-sourcing" the last part of the distribution to your door.
If you want great food, just drive or walk a few minutes and pick it up!

See <http://www.meetup.com/FullOfLifeFood/> to find out where FoLF is delivering great food near you, and join in with us on a purchase.
